What you need:

- KDE >= 3.2
- Qt
- All development packages for KDE (kdelibs & qt)

To install configure the program with the correct prefix for
your KDE installation (like /usr or /opt/kde3 or similar)

./configure --prefix=...

And finally:

make install

Now you should be able to run the "kalternatives" command.
